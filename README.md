Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to our Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository contains a variety of projects ranging from basic to intermediate levels. Whether you're a beginner looking to dive into the world of machine learning or an intermediate practitioner seeking to expand your skills, you'll find something valuable here.

Project Types:

1. Classification Projects:
   - Predicting classes or categories of data based on input features.
   - Example: Iris Flower Classification, MNIST Digit Recognition.

2. Regression Projects:
   - Predicting continuous values based on input features.
   - Example: Housing Price Prediction, Stock Price Forecasting.

3. Clustering Projects:
   - Grouping similar data points into clusters based on their features.
   - Example: Customer Segmentation, Document Clustering.

4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects:
   - Analyzing and processing text data to extract insights or perform tasks.
   - Example: Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition.

5. Image Processing Projects:
   - Analyzing and manipulating images to extract features or perform tasks.
   - Example: Object Detection, Facial Recognition.



Each project comes with:
- Code implementation in Python.
- Documentation explaining the project, datasets used, methodology, and results.
- Instructions on how to run the code and reproduce the results.
